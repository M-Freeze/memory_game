# Memory Game (AngularJS Edition)

Simple 4 by 4 memory game.

It was written using AngularJS and Bootstrap.


##How To Play
When the game loads, select a question mark bubble to reveal a picture. Select another bubble to try and find the matching picture. If the pictures match, both will turn red to signify they have been matched. If they don't match, they will revert back into question mark bubbles and you may pick the same, or new question mark bubbles to find a match.

To reset the game, hit the 'Reset' button.

## Notes

Forked and edited to use AngularJS instead of Jquery
